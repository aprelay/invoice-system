## ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKE - How to Avoid Error

### ❌ WRONG - Don't do this:
- Selecting the ZIP file itself
- Selecting a folder with another folder inside
- Selecting a folder with only a ZIP file

### ✅ CORRECT - Do this:
- Extract the ZIP first
- Select the folder with the 7 files visible
- manifest.json should be directly in that folder

## 🔍 How to Check You Selected Right Folder

When you browse for the folder in Chrome:
1. Look at the file list on the right
2. You should see: `manifest.json`, `content.js`, `popup.html`, etc.
3. If you see a ZIP file or another folder, go deeper!

## 📂 Folder Structure Example

**Correct Structure:**
```
Documents/
  └── email-extractor-extension/  ← SELECT THIS FOLDER
      ├── manifest.json
      ├── content.js
      ├── popup.html
      ├── popup.js
      ├── icon16.png
      ├── icon48.png
      └── icon128.png
```

**Wrong Structure (nested folder):**
```
Documents/
  └── email-extractor-extension/
      └── email-extractor-extension/  ← This means you need to go deeper!
          ├── manifest.json
          ├── content.js
          └── ...
```
